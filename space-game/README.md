# Space game

The game has an idea to steer a spaceship and fire on monsters that come down from above. Once all enemy ships have been destroyed, you win the game. Your ship has three lives. Every time a your ship is destroyed it deducts a your life. Once all lives have been lost then you lose the game. Good luck!
